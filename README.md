# face-recognition
• Developed an facial recognition app which is will detect faces of my classmates\\n
• Built a facial recognition app using Python, integrating MTCNN for precise face detection and cropping, enhancing dataset quality.
• Implemented data augmentation to expand the dataset, improving model performance.
• Utilized FaceNet library to extract facial features, ensuring accuracy and robustness in representation.
• Employed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality, improving computational efficiency while maintaining accuracy.
• Achieved a remarkable 98% accuracy rate in identifying classmates' faces using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification.
